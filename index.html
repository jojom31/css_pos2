            <p>Consistency<br>
                You don’t know what you did to me<br>
                You showed a side that allowed you in<br>
                And in again<br>
                Because you  were consistent<br>
                In the beginning, now its different<br>
                Not consistent<br>
                But once again you’re in<br>
                How do I let this mend<br>
                I can’t because once again<br>
                Consistent in your inconsistency <br>
                Which I relentlessly wonder<br>
                Is it worth it<br>
                I know I’m worth it<br>
                But are you worth it<br>
                It being my consistency<br>

            <p>If you allow the past in your present<br>
                Your future is nonexistent<br>  
                How can you be persistent<br>
                Or even consistent<br>
                If you can’t allow the past distance<br> 
                From the old that continues to scold you<br>
                Not mold you into the person<br>
                You want to be<br>
                The past can sometimes become a faded memory<br>
                You maybe holding on willingly<br> 
                The present is the focus<br> 
                If you are always worrying about<br>
                What’s gonna happen or<br>
                What’s supposed to happen <br>
                You miss out on<br>
                Whats happening right now<br>
                Don’t wait around<br>
                Embrace life<br>
                Get past this life<br>
                Of regret<br>
                And be met with peace<br>
                Let it go so you can grow<br>
                I know it’s hard it’s just that feeling<br>
                Of something new <br>
                Oh look you grew<br>
                Look around so much has changed<br>
                You blocked the past from your present<br> 
                Now your future exists<br>
                You overcame that fear of what if<br>
                                                             -JoJo
